<h1>Fusion360/OrcaSlicer</h1>
All stls (and assembly) have a 0.4mm under chamfer to account for elephant's foot (Set to 0 in settings)
Make sure all stls are orientated so that the chamfer plane (which is the bottom) is touching the plate.  The model was designed for this, being modular, to allow easier printing.
